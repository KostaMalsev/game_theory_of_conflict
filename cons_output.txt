There isn't really much about the program that I dislike. I don't like that the automations now have two types of files (legacy and templates). They are basically the same and it really makes no sense to me why they exist separately, but it doesn't impede on using the software. Also, the reporting is good but it doesn't really make sense as it's not as functional as I'd like. You can't look at a report in the program, you have to download every time, but, I make due with what's available.
To use all the features of CRM, you need to hire a pro who can set you back at least $2k. Also, the payment deposits are the slowest on the market - days! If you use Square, you get the deposit the next day - same for all other CRMs. If you receive a payment on a Wednesday, for example, you won't get that deposit until at least Monday.
This product was pitched to our team as the supreme tool for doc management / / sharing / signatures, but it was no different, and had less features, than similar tools
The financial reports are not accurate. Also need easier login for multiple business logins. Deposits take a little longer sometimes
There's not much to like about it. It meets all of the things I was looking for in a CRM.
I would like more creative ability within the documents. Also don't like how some of the documents including invoices interact. It's hard to explain. It's both easy and complicated at the same time.
The setup process is a bit tricky and unless you have familiarized yourself with template creation, pay someone to build your templates, or find a premade on to edit to work for your needs it is a bit overwhelming if you have no experience at all with creating online templates or websites.
I honestly have no complaints about HoneyBook.
What I like least about HoneyBook is that there is no way to add a global discount code to a product or all products.
I do not have anything I like the least at the moment.
The templates are basic. For our business specifically we had to basically create a template, but that was the only negative.
Absolutely not user-friendly. I have used quite a few payment platforms but couldn't even send an invoice using this program.
The customer service can take a while to answer the phone or resolve a problem online
I have no complaints so far using HoneyBook.
There is nothing that I dislike about Honeybook.
Nothing, the application is fantastic!! I am so glad we have this amazing tool for our business!
HoneyBook does not allow client data to be exported. This may be an issue for those who would like to transfer the data within the contracts to another platform / tool. There is also a need for more integration with other platforms.
I haven't quite gotten around to learning all aspects of the software yet!
The mobile app, while handy, doesn’t offer all the features available on the desktop version, which can be a bit frustrating when you're on the go. Also, it’s a bit pricey, so it might not be the best option if you’re just starting out or have a tight budget.
I don’t think I have had any set backs with this
The price is expensive for solopreneurs. The features are overwhelming and there is a steep learning curve.
Can be a little confusing at first but eventually I learned about the tools.
One of the areas where I feel this platform could use some improvement is its reporting and analytics functionality. While the platform provides basic data on projects, payments, and clients, I would like access to more advanced and customizable metrics that allow me to more closely track how my business is performing.
They did an update this past year that has allowed for a lot of great automations. The only thing is, it has been extremely hard to keep up with and figure out how to use. (And I am pretty tech savy) But I do think they are great tools, it just takes a bit of time to figure out the changes. If you are new to honeybook, it's all you may know so it might work great!
Really no problem I like it I'm working on honeyBook today great and safe I hope see honeyBook soon number 1 on world service payment
With honey book it was very user friendly.
There are some small things i wish where available in the smart files, such as drop down lists and check boxes.
There are not many negatives to HoneyBook, all the tools are easy to use, records are always up to date, notifications are excellent and all transactions are documented efficiently.
I actually have no cons. My experience with Honey has been great.
The response time from customer service is not as effective and fast as I would like, they are good at their responses but they don't do it quickly
It’s not as good for booking group classes for clients compared to other websites. I will use the other website is set more...
The system has never failed me, I feel satisfied with each tool I use and I am convinced that it has been the most efficient platform that I use for my work tasks.
It didn't have the features I needed for the internal side of things when delegating to other contractors or staff
I don't have any dislikes thus far regarding the platform.
Customization was very limitrd. Not being able to add a designed invoice was a deal breaker for me.
Cuatomer service was a little slow responding to a question i had.
There really isn't anything that I don't like about Honeybook.
It became a little overwhelming when I was starting my business. It offered more than I needed. (good problem to have!)
I had a bit of trouble acclimating to emailing within the platform but now I have adjusted and know how easy it can be! Sometimes the emails land in client's spam but only once in a while!
The customer service response time isn't as prompt and efficient as I hope; while they provide good answers, they don't respond quickly.
Client experience if poor. Integrations are awful. Layout, design and look are atrocious and check out for clients is multi step.....Who does that anymore? We spent a week trying to get it setup and working well and efficiently....no way it was going to. And if we have to handhold it and manually do a TON of things.....why bother? MANY other options available and we've moved to one.
All the processes are useful and have had no inconsistencies in use, so on my part everything has turned out satisfactory.
As compared to others, The payout speed for invoices takes close to a week as opposed to a couple of days with other software I have tried. Perhaps that will change in the future.
Para quienes inician, pagar una mensualidad de esta clase puede ser un poco difícil, por lo tanto, al ser una aplicación enfocada en empresas pequeñas que están iniciando, debo darle un punto en contra al hecho del precio para quienes inician, debería haber una opción limitada para quienes inician con diferentes tipos de negocios
It could have better contract signing features.
No customer service. When they charge incorrectly you cannot reach them to get it corrected. Product was not impressive to start to have to deal with this billing issue.
Initial customisation takes time. Limited integration with certain third party apps.
I really enjoy using HONEYBOOK and all its features
Considering how helpful HoneyBook has been, no complaints.
limited advanced customization for workflows and only basic reporting.
There is currently nothing I dislike about Honeybook, it has been very effective and efficient.
I honestly don’t have any cons. This program is by far the best of it’s kind.
Pricing could be a little better but overall I really don’t have any cons.
I didn’t like that the pricing system was very high, especially for startup businesses
What I liked least about it was the price.
Still learning all the capabilities but no complaints yet
Il bouffe assez trop en connexion internet
Honeybook doesn't let you use your own email address after configuration.
That it doesn't connect or integrate at all to my other primary platform I use on a regular and daily basis.
I wish it was easier to integrate with other software.
Hi,If you don't want to be scammed, you must stay away from HoneyBook.Don't waste your valuable time and business by using HoneyBook.I won't say much, just say that if you accept payment through Honeybook, the payment will not come to you.Thank you
Unfortunately my clients said it was confusing and they didn't know how to work inside of it to do edits etc.
Price is pretty expensive for small businesses. There is no built-in time tracking.
I find it really expensive and it's not known to the general public.
Long term it just wasn't for me and my business
Should be able to have more functionality
Haven't found anything yet, perhaps as we go along. We are considering expanding our use to include invoicing and billing and will update review at that time.
While HoneyBook had many positive aspects, one thing I liked least was the limited reporting and analytics capabilities. The platform provided basic insights into my business metrics, such as income and project status, but I would have appreciated more in-depth reporting and analytics features. It would be beneficial to have access to more comprehensive data and visualizations to gain a deeper understanding of my business performance and make data-driven decisions.
Nothing wrong to report. A few bugs every now and then but I haven't seen one in a while.
There is virtually nothing about HoneyBook that I could ever say I don't like. HoneyBook has actually captured my heart. If I had one wish, it would be for a wider variety of design possibilities that are especially suited for producing compelling proposals and brochures. My love and admiration for HoneyBook, however, remain unwavering despite this nagging longing. Its extensive capabilities and user-friendly UI unquestionably improved my business operations to remarkable levels.
For the moment, I don't feel that anything with HoneyBook is missing at all.
Being able to navigate and the pricing per month.
Cost was expensive long term and not in out budget at the time but they do work with small businesses to help with that during slow times
So far i am very satisfied about all the feature from HoneyBook. Thank you !
Purtroppo, anche se Honeybook ha molte funzionalità interessanti, devo esprimere alcune critiche sulla piattaforma.Innanzitutto, il prezzo di Honeybook è piuttosto elevato rispetto ad altre soluzioni simili presenti sul mercato. Questo potrebbe essere un problema per molti freelance e piccole imprese che hanno un budget limitato e che non possono permettersi di pagare costi elevati per la gestione della loro attività.Inoltre, nonostante la piattaforma offra molte funzioni utili, ho notato che l'interfaccia utente di Honeybook può risultare un po' confusionaria e poco intuitiva. In particolare, ho trovato alcuni processi di configurazione dei modelli di contratto e dei form di contatto piuttosto complicati e poco user-friendly.Un altro aspetto negativo di Honeybook è che alcune funzionalità avanzate, come la possibilità di creare sondaggi personalizzati, sono disponibili solo per gli utenti che hanno sottoscritto il piano premium. Ciò significa che i clienti che hanno scelto il piano base potrebbero non avere accesso a tutte le funzioni di cui hanno bisogno per gestire la loro attività in modo efficace
Considero que los precios de HoneyBook son un poco elevados, especialmente para las pequeñas empresas.
Lack of integration with other softwares, it would be usefull p.e. to use with some microsoft programs.
None so far! I like this Honeybook. It is helpful to my business.
limited integrations and customisation to meet different types of businesses
L' interfaccia grafica non mi fa impazzire, ma è un opinione personale.
Quizás un punto negativo podría ser su precio. Aunque ofrece una prueba gratuita y planes de suscripción mensuales y anuales, para algunos usuarios puede resultar caro.
It stinks that Honeybook costs more than the other small business CRMs. It's got the extra stuff, yeah. But I wish they could bring it down a little. The other thing is that I wish they would let more outside apps integrate.
Customer service is pass-the-buck and no phone number and call backs hours to days later…don’t bother calling on a Friday afternoon, and if u do biz on weekends - too bad for you. Extremely slow to create something, it freezes, slow to upload assets, not intuitive to use whatsoever, help docs are vague. I once begged them to add non-gmail email and they told me their software was “not sophisticated” enough for me.
HoneyBook offers a range of pricing plans that are designed to be accessible to businesses of all sizes, the cost can add up quickly if you require a large number of features or have a high volume of transactions.Another potential issue with HoneyBook is its limited customization options. While the platform does provide users with a range of templates and pre-built workflows, some users may find that these are not customizable enough to fit their specific needs.
I have no complaints except that the proof reading capability could be enhanced in the platform and/or translation options available.
En mi opinión algo que deberían mejorar un poco es la interfaz, por momentos se hace pesada al cargar los elementos.
There are a few features I feel could be improved in Honeybook. The most notable one being a better editing and proofreading capability within the platform. Currently, it is difficult and tedious to check and make corrections to text, image and colors throughout a project.It would be great if there was an automated system that could help with this.
The worst part about it is getting started, but even THAT is pretty simple with their "concierge service" where you can send them your current forms and they'll digitize them for you!
HoneyBook shines for many industry professionals but isn't without a few details in need of improvement. Uploading files to customize templates can be difficult due to the restrictions placed on file types and sizes. Businesses with more non-traditional models may also find HoneyBook difficult to customize to meet their needs.
I'd love to see more detailed task management for independent contractors' collaboration, and for clients. I'd also request that HoneyBook connect with Zapier alternatives such as Pabbly Connect, Integrately, and Integromat.
Honestly, I don't really have anything I don't like. Maybe more space within the pipeline to be more tailored to my business (able to add more) And I'd like the option of uploading PDF's to templates like brochure. I like honey books brochure making ability.. but I also want more features and more control. Like building a webpage on squarespace. SO FUN
Starting out was the hardest part. As with any new software you must familiarize yourself with the product.
I am not too crazy about not being able to have one client on multiple workflows and the calendar feature is not as robust.
- Fees especially for third party countries- Some limited integration issues
The only thing that’s a little slow is the payment actually getting to my bank account. I’m not even sure if HB has anything to do with the time it takes, but I do wish it didn’t take 2 days to finally show up in my account. I wish there was an option to “instantly” transfer the funds for like a 1% fee. Like Venmo! That way if someone needs the money ASAP, they can instantly get it OR they can choose to wait the 1-2 business days to get the full payment. That would AMAZING
1. The email communication side of the app is very hit or miss. Where they soar with sending files and making payments a BREEZE, the ability to create a streamlined, semi-automated Follow-up process for leads that come in is sorely lacking. Even if HoneyBook never intends to be the best at that portion of sales, I feel it is a simple task to add a feature that makes it easy to add tags to leads so that you can export those contacts to a service that DOES soar in email communication and lead nurturing. 2. There is still a lot of room for more organization in the communication process from sales to project completion.
The cost of transitions when collecting online payments from clients
I want more email customization - better html features - add photo to my signature, add gifs, rename buttons and add them wherever I want in the email. I'd like it to manage my items better - have a place where I can update item pricing and descriptions and archive old items. I'd like better customization around the contact forms. Be able to match the text and font and fields closely to my website so that it integrates better onto my design. Be able to change colors of text and lines, and fonts and customize the lead contact form better.
The only things I wish that HoneyBook would improve on the most would be trying different variations with the project pipeline, with adding more availability or being able to choose between pipelines for different project types, & working out some kinks with the scheduling system between what we intend for clients to see in availability & what they actually see; & for the client to be able to go in & change their selection of date & time immediately afterwards & up to half an hour later.
How To guide is helpful to an extent. There were still things such as the automations and other issues I needed help with by my mentor who is also a photographer. She helped me set up my whole process cause it does not give you an example to let you know where to start with brochures, packages, invoice creations, etc.
I have very few quibbles with the software. Perhaps a bit more obvious control over the aesthetics of the brochures and documents would be nice, and I would love some additional automation, but overall the system works great and makes it so easy to manage everything that I have a hard time finding anything to complain about. I suppose that I would love an i-frame-based embed for the contact form. My portfolio site doesn't work with the embed type that honeybook provides.
The tasks need to be improved. The tasks only allow you to add it, but it doesn't allow the tasks to be sent to your email if it due tomorrow or today. You have to see the tasks in Honeybook to remember to do it. Also, I have the same tasks to do weekly, and you can't set up reoccurring tasks, which is a waste of time to type them in every week. The invoices need to be improved. Lots of my consulting clients are not allowed to use portals to go find the invoice. SO I have to print PDF the invoice and send it via email to my client. However, the print to PDF option does not make the PDF look very professional. It needs to be upgraded.
The client payment processing fees are more pricey than what I’ve used in the past and the instant deposit fees are through the roof. It takes up to 4 days otherwise for payments to arrive in your account, but I just wait it out due to the astronomical fees.
I would love to see a more flexible method for viewing pipelines and tasks. I prefer to view a Kanban-type of pipeline/workflow and tasks. I'd like to be able to click on a workflow and see how many clients/projects I have under it. I also don't like that I can't charge for certain appointment types. I would love to use the scheduling feature for booking mini sessions or other items that I would charge for outside of weddings/brand sessions. It would also be great if certain appointment types could work as lead capture forms (i.e.: when an appointment is booked, a new inquiry is created). For financial tracking, it would be nice to be able to create a recurring expense.
The calendar sync is sometimes glitchy, but that could also be user error. One thing that would make it better would be an easy way to override when I am considered "busy" on my Google Calendar that syncs in. I'd also love to have SMS communication with my clients, but rumor has it they are working on this.
There are little things that can be improved, but so does everything. I have voiced my suggestions to the HoneyBook team and they are passing the information along to try to improve my experience. Even without those being fixed, I still love HoneyBook.
The time tracker does not function to the extent that I need it to. I currently use Time Doctor to track my time, but it would be nice if I could keep everything in HoneyBook. Also, I oftentimes don't see my reminders for following up with "tasks" for clients in my projects pipeline. If there's a way to have those notifications automatically sync with my personal google calendar and send me an email reminder, that would be helpful. Pipedrive's CRM and sales pipeline does a really great job of showing urgent prospects to follow up with. I think it color-codes them too. Also, the email feature within HoneyBook can be a bit confusing. Sometimes, I can't tell if an email sent or not. The notes are also not displayed in a way that's very easy to read. It would be nice to add bullets, bold text, underline, etc. Pipedrive does a really great job of showing all of the email threads and notes between clients and multiple team members in their CRM. Also, the first time I sent an invoice, HoneyBook automatically included a place for gratuity/tip. I've now figured out how to turn that setting off, but I couldn't see that it was automatically included in my invoice ahead of time. With my business (and I think most), they will never need gratuity, so I think that's kind of an odd setting. Maybe instead of having to click and review the settings in the left side bar of invoices, there could be an extra prompt to review those settings before the user sends the proposal to their client.
The only thing I would like to see, and truly, I haven't asked, so it may even be there already; the monthly report of income shows the total of all contracts that came in during the month. We only collect a deposit from each. We would like to see the income report reflect just the deposit total of the month for our accounting purposes.
It takes a little effort to get to know the template process and what templates your business needs. We found that for a while we were nonstop creating templates because we offer such a variety of services. But now we have built up our system of templates that can easily be customized for a client.
It's annoying that I can't delete the default emails that came with my account to replace them with my own workflow, so myself or a team member doesn't get confused with their suggested emails vs. the ones I actually want to use.
I wish it was a little more upscale looking on fonts, colors and the user experience. My brand is more of a luxury brand so I want customers to feel like when they're being transferred to the contract or payment portion of our interactions that they're still receiving a luxury experience.
Would like to have more ability to make formatting changes (bullets, numbering, bold, etc.) when editing a document. I can do this on a new document, but not when editing an existing one. Workflows could be improved to have more triggers and the ability to automatically send files.
I don't like how many separate emails I need to make to send out my appointment scheduling.
The only con is that I didn’t find honeybook sooner! I don’t know how I did business without it. I look back at those times and laugh at how much work I was doing that didn’t even amount to half of what honeybook does for me!
I dislike that there is no option to arrange your date before booking. I only wish clients could choose the amount they want to pay at any given moment. Some of my clients find the email threads quite bothersome. In comparison to other firms, the processing and quick deposit costs appear to be expensive.
We wish the saving option when creating templated would improve due to work not being saved correctly. The undo option would be great. THE TEMPLATES. I just wish there were more as we use schedule emails frequently for follow ups, discovery calls, referrals, reminders, announcement, etc. The purpose of Smart Files is kind of pointless if I have to keep customizing my own templates.
I hope they allow us to ACTUALLY customize our project pipeline at some point. Not everyone has the same process, and there is stuff I can't take off because it's default. I also wish there was an easier way to just send someone to the item to be sold page rather than taking them to a pipeline, we all get leads differently, and I'd like to skip a step for some people.
I was expecting more from the workflow and would love the option to create a link so clients can open the link to get to the invoice to make the payment. As much as I’d love everyone to use the client portal, not everyone can handle it and this would be a great feature for older, less tech-savvy clients.
The app. The time tracking - the fact you have to calculate the time in fractions, what should have been an easy task becomes a "let me google what 1h35min is in time fractions". You can just put the time in the app, but not on the webapp. But I can never login at the app because it doesn't accept Google SSO, but it does on the web, so I always have to change my password. The app doesn't stay connected for long. So I just don't use the app, I have it installed because maybe one day it will update and login with Google.
Truthfully, I can't really think of anything that I would add or change about HoneyBook. They have been really thoughtful in their development process.
There are times when I donate photo sessions to non-profits and want to be able to send an invoice showing how much the session would have cost, then adding a discount to show a $0 invoice but there is not a way to send that without charging the invoice and refunding. I wish that I could do more on the mobile app, but new features are being added frequently.
The contract templates are pretty limited to social media management and marketing ops. I think that every business needs their own contracts, period, but it would be nice to have a better starting place for other service providers. Additionally, the emails that Honeybook kicks out for proposals, payments, contracts and the like have reportedly found their way to many of my customer's spam box. I just warn them ahead of time, but it's not super reassuring to some more leery customers.
I would like it if the appointment scheduler allowed us to ask prospects questions and charge a fee like Calendly, and that the time tracker was more profound like Clockify.
There could maybe be more freedom to customize but really it's just an advanced issue. First world problems.
Sometimes editing things for a client when they don't like it is more difficult such as payment dates or legal terms if you include the contract with the invoice in the proposal template.
There’s a little room for improvement, which the wonderful customer service has my suggestions about, but those things will only enhance an already great product.
After a client pays their invoice, it usually takes 12-24 hours for Honeybook to send me a confirmation email saying they've paid. This is (I don't use this word often) absurd. With Quickbooks, I know payment confirmation comes in within 10 minutes. Especially if I am going to start work with a client right as they pay, this hurdle in their platform stops me from getting to work right away. It usually leads to me emailing my customer "Did you pay the invoice?" then them replying "I did!" then me looking into Honeybook wondering why the heck it hasn't come in and making me look foolish to my client... Then I finally get the notification the next day. It's the #1 feature request they need to get updated.
The program has so many capabilities that I know I am not using it to its full potential. Because each company is different I know it would be impossible to walk everyone through what their company needs but I wish I could snap my fingers and understand it all
1. I wish there was more internal automation, like the workflow applied just sent out the emails and not prompted me to act. 2. While “linked” with Calendly, it’s not linked in the correct way. I wish when someone signed up for a slot in Calendly, it could generate an automatic proposal that I could look over before sending, or sent automatically. When adding my “Calendly link” to a honeybook email, the link always fails. I don’t use Calendly enough to have this be a major issue, just a nuisance. 3. More flexibility in personal branding & branding the contact form. I don’t currently use the form on my site because of this.
I have no cons. This meets and exceeds all expectations that I would have for a CRM.
The only thing I’m not too big on is app limitation. I need a few more feature like editing calendar and schedule availability when I’m not on my iPad or computer and just have my phone.
I wish I could have had the same email signature in the platform as I did on my email platform.
The only complaint I have is that you can’t access all the same features and do all the same things on the Honeybook app as you can on a computer. This is only a very minor dislike because most important features are usable in the app!
A couple of things I would like to see improved on would be workflow triggers and customization of default emails.
I don't have a con...Although it is worth each penny that they charge, it is hard justifying when business stopped bc of a virus (which shall not be named lol) I wanted to keep it to keep everything together but could not when even communication stopped with clients for a while.
I am a new user and it's a little difficult to set up to how I do business. It's taking me a lot longer than I would like to get things just how I want them. There are things I want to change such as the flow of automatic emails. I am having a hard time figuring out exactly where to change those settings.
The only thing i wish were better is the calendar system. It would be nice to be able to block dates out on the calendar to avoid booking, like if you had planned a vacation. I also with it would sync directly to ical. I hate having to make it use google becuase if google runs out of space it doesnt tell me and then i have a calendar issue.
In contracts the most frustrating thing is that you can only add line items at the very bottom of the invoice. That means if you have a very long invoice and want to add a line to the top of the page, you have to add a line at the bottom and drag it all the way up to the top ( which is extremely tedious ). It wastes so much time that it made me wonder if we wasted more time trying to use this clunky app than just doing things the way we were used to in excel!
Some things aren't really intuitive so I have to use the help resources or ask customer support for help in figuring things out. The great thing is that the support team is really easy to chat with and makes things really simple.
I am a "founding" Honeybook user and bought the lifetime membership. At first, HB was very convenient. The learning curve was very frustrating as the online software had many MANY bugs. It still does. The entire premise behind the software was to free up your time, have all your projects in one place, sign contract, get paid, etc. Yes, great idea! However, the software has so many glitches! You're not able to even edit a person in your contacts. Their customer support team used to be great you could actually message a real person - now you have to wait a day or two to get an email answer and most of the time they just send you a link to deal with your problem. Once you email your client the contract, everything goes down the Honeybook "rabbit hole". My clients are tech savvy and they can't even figure out Honeybook - the emails that I've received from frustrated clients is numerous. Save your time and money and get another online software that will actually do the job - like Sprout Studio or Dubsado. Wish I would have done that from the beginning. Regretting my purchase since my lifetime "membership" isn't transferrable and Honeybook continues to make money off of me by accepting credit card payments. I looked at 17hats, which also didn't have great reviews before I purchased Honeybook. Moving on, however, I'm assuming that the process will not be easy transferring existing contracts and other office files.
Couple little things here and there, like a box won't move where I want it to in Flows, but they are always tweaking and adding new features. The customer service is also stellar so if anything goes wrong I know someone will be able to help me right away!
I have nothing bad to say about Honeybook
All is great and hope to learn about more tools that I am not using
As a professional designer, I'm used to being able to create whatever I need in my design software, but was thrilled to be able to remove that tedious aspect from my workflow after setting up brochures in HoneyBook. I would love some increased functionality and flexibility in those brochure templates, but that's certainly not going to keep me from using this amazing tool.
For our industry, it is lacking an edidable document such as a BEO or Event Details Sheet - I wish this type of document would be an option.
After booking the client; PM automations are quite lacking - would need a separate solution to assist with that. Would love for it to be incorporated
The scheduling app could be more robust, but I still love it.
There is nothing about Honeybook that I would change.
It is a lot to set up in the beginning but way worth it. It saves so much time in the long run with workflows and saved templates.
- it would be cool if the email editor in the platform had more functionality but the workaround is to style your email in a Google doc and copy/paste it into the editor (assuming you don't want to include GIFs of videos- which have to be sent as attachments)
I wish it had better financials. More comprehensive reports and the ability to auto populate expenses into their categories.
Can’t think of anything I don’t like about this software.
There's really not much I don't use or don't like. I would like for my call scheduling to be able to automatically sync to my iCal for my iphone, and maybe some personalized help on automating workflows, but these are wish list items!
Some of the features I would like to see in the future would be the ability to integrate a "store"-like function directly into the crm. I would like my clients to be able to choose from options that I offer and those choices to become a proposal or invoice.
I honestly can't think of anything I don't like. I thought I liked my old program a few years ago, but when it went defunct and I had to change, I was so grateful I was forced into an upgrade. I did not know what I was missing. This program simplified the management of my business beyond what I thought was possible.
The amount of time and understanding of the software and processes needed to create your leads management, project management, proposal, and booking pipelines is overwhelming sometimes alot is truly too much.
I think in the beginning there was a learning curve that was pretty tough. However, customer service was absolutely amazing and helped a lot. I would recommend adding a way to upload receipts to the business expenses! I’d love to just export that into a spreadsheet for my accountant and they have everything they need there. I do not use Quickbooks as I bookkeep everything myself. So that could help a lot!
As a business owner and freelancer, I find HoneyBook to be an excellent tool. However, there are a few areas where it could use improvement. For instance, while it has many templates and tools to help streamline business processes, I find it difficult to customize the software to fit my individual needs. Additionally, the user interface can be challenging to navigate for those who are not tech-savvy, making the learning curve a bit steep.
I was basically using email, so having all of my communication in one place made things so much easier. It's my one stop place for keeping track of communication with clients and their designs/perferences throughout the planning process.
The mobile app as with any mobile app version of software is a little bit more limited but that is the only thing that bothers me. Most things I can still accomplish with ease.
Absolutely nothing. It’s flawless, and every time they come up with something new, it’s something I never knew I needed. There’s nothing to not like!
I really wish that Batch Emailing had more options. We often need to send specific batch emails to our clients dependednt on which stage they are at on our timeline. Only having the options to hand select each client to send the batch emails to or to send them to our entire client list is an inefficient use of our time and thus we find no use for this tool that has so much potential to be so valuable to our business.
Definitely Would like to see a review questionnaire or rating system with an HTML generator plugin that could be used to post on my website or google ad. Updated training videos for the new features.
Of all the features in honey book, I would love to see an actual timer. The hours log is excellent adding a clock to this feature would put it over the top!
It took me a while to navigate through all the different options. I think a run-through video would be amazing!
I would like the ability to look up a clients files by date - the calendar only shows bookings that have a retainer paid. I'd like to search by date and find prospectives. I'd like to search by category - for instance school dances versus weddings versus company parties. And, I'd like to see reports of how many of each type of gig we do each year.
No I'm very happy. There's honestly nothing I would change.
The only thing have to say that is bad about this program is when there is an update of change. Opening up the program to do something and finding that things have changed with no notice is frustrating.
Hasta el momento no he tenido inconvenientes con Honeybook, el sistema va de maravilla y siempre que tengo una duda puedo consultar a servicio de atención al cliente.
The only thing I would like to see is an option to merge/combine projects. As a wedding planner, I'm often included in contracts sent to my couples. It's no surprise that they use HoneyBook too! I end up with multiple projects for the same couple from different vendors.
I would like a more robust Archive management, and a comprehensive workflow automation system, but I know they are working on it.
If I absolutely had to say something I didn’t like. It would be that I wish I could upload bigger pictures so that I could make better brochures/ contracts.
During the initial trial with honeybook, I did not use it at all. I found it confusing and really did not know where to start or how to start it. I decided if I was going to really see what it I was all about I needed help. I hired a HB Pro [SENSITIVE CONTENT] and that made the world of difference. Of course, when I hired a pro before I ever used HB, I asked myself what I was doing spending money on a program I can’t even use !!!LOL. [SENSITIVE CONTENT] is very important to me and her automations and beautiful graphics opened up a world of HB.
The only thing I'm having issues with right now is making a brochure. It probably user error, but I wish it there more extensive editing capabilities within the brochure making operation. I will play around with it some more though.
I have very few negative things to say about HoneyBook. The couple things I did note that may be helpful in the future, HoneyBook wants to know about. They offer surveys and take users suggestions to possibly implement in the future. All things were very minor and don't take away from the overall experience of using HoneyBook.
I wish there were more options for the pre made templates, that we can title and choose from. For now, I can only make the one follow up email. There are others that I would like to make. Also, I wish I could change the body of the email and it would save it to how I would like to word it. For now, I have to change some wording around every time I send out files to my potential clients. I also really would like to be able to make a timeline through HoneyBook. For now I have to create it in another space and email it separately to my client. It would be nice to have it all under the same file, especially with handling so many brides and weddings.
Con mentioned in previous question when asked how can you improve
Aunque HoneyBook tiene una plataforma muy intuitiva, si es necesario que realices configuraciones según los requerimientos del emprendedor, esto puede tomar algo de tiempo.
I have not experienced any glitches on the platform that was not solved very quickly. One glitch I had recently was that the project page was not loading, but they had a notification on the side stating that their team is already working on this issue before I noticed it.
I don’t like how I can’t edit proposals and invoices through my cellphone on the app, and how long it takes to receive payment.
I wish there was a reward system to offer my clients. Something that would give them a discount on their next purchase with me once they’ve spent a certain amount with our business. It would be nice if HoneyBook could integrate that option.
The only feature I wish I could have used a little differently would be a way to connect a Google Drive folder (it's where I work through content for a web design project with my client, so it needs to be more collaborative than a final pdf)
I would like to see more scheduling abilities from the app.
Sometimes it is too progressive for me! I am after all a photog and not a tech geek. That’s when I reach out for help, and the support team is there to walk me through.
I would like the ability to chose the date of expiration, versus week to week.
- Refunds don’t sync to QuickBooks - 3% payment processing fee is too expensive - Delay in funds being deposited into bank account - Inability to charge different sales tax rates for different items.
Not anything major to say, other than the iOS app is a little limited to what can be done on it. Compared to the laptop / desktop web browser version.
I least like that I cannot decide more of what I would like my clients to be able to see within the project. (I may be incorrect in saying this and not yet know how to do this.)
no scheduling within the software in which I heard they were working on this. The ability to add someone that works for you and not see contract just logistics.
I wish I could integrate it into my website.
The only con I have found with Honeybook is the lack of a download feature for contracts and invoices after they've been executed.
Being a new product there are some areas that would be nice to see (i.e. reimbursable expense capture) but has all of the core features you really need to make the investment worth it.
They're stuck in the Stripe system for payments with zero other options. We run our businesses using PayPal and the lack of paymention options pales in comparison to a couple of the CRM competitors out there. The app could use with a UX/UI redesign for the new decade. It's easy to use, but could be much better.
I do wish, that the scheduling aspect was better equip for mini sessions, and different events you can host!
The only thing that is missing for me right now is that there are no integrations with other accounting programs besides quickbooks, and that the task management portion isn't quite as robust as I would like it to be.
When responding to an email through the software, it makes a new email. Some clients have more questions and I’d like a way to organize with in a project the emails.
I wish I could add gifs to my emails. They are kinda my thing.
I wish the system was able to better track email correspondence in a long tread that was readable by both the customers and the user.
I don't have much to dislike about Honeybook! The only thing that I think could use improvement is the mobile app functionality, but it is mobile and therefore limited. I also wish that I would've been exposed to team workflows early on, but it's not hard to figure out once you have a general understanding of the software!
I don't like the scheduling too much and that there is no way to tag people in the same groups.
The ONLY things I dislike about the software are very minor. I wish that I could customize the project phases more, I wish that I had a live stop/start time tracking feature, I wish that I could customize the wording of my payment reminders, I wish that I could send an invoice from a proposal without duplicating the payment in the project (clients ask for that for their records), and I wish there was an iPad app.
The learning curve is a little higher than other applications, but I think it is because it is so unique in its mission - to help organize multiple parts of a photography business.
I would like to be able to track if a client clicks on a URL or opens an attachment within an email. Currently, you can only see if they've opened the email and how many times. This would be extremely helpful.
Landing page options and or lead magnet delivery option from contact form.
Difficult for clients to find current versions of proposals when looking for it from emails Some shortcomings when working with teams (sharing proposals / contracts / invoices)
Honestly there’s not really a whole lot of cons the only one that I can think of is that the mobile app is not as interactive as if you were using a computer or laptop but honey book constantly works on improving things so I’m sure that in the future it will be fully interactive from your phone where you can check on things like bookkeeping and Send out contacts faster. So for me it’s not really a con just something to be aware of other than that I really honestly can’t really think of any cons.
If email marketing was built in, this would be an incredible way to manage leads and stay connected to my customers! Since I also do coaching, it would be helpful to have paid session options in the scheduler to allow my clients to schedule and pay at the same time.
There really isn’t much that I don’t like about it. Some stores are not currently with honey books and that would be my only true complaint!
I wish I could go back to an email besides the last one and still reply to that rather than have to always start a new thread. I don't like that I can't tell if I have sent the Client Portal link to a client or not. I have a difficult time with the copy/paste function on my keyboard inside Honeybook.
Vendors I've worked with have used Honeybook for contracts and payment to reserve workshop spaces. While it was easy to access and deliver payment, I found that the information in the shared account was not encrypted. So sensitive information like full payment methods were visible to anyone who had access to the account. This made me uneasy in the instance someone would gain access to the shared documents who did not have permission.
I wish that there was the option to tax different parts within an invoice (ie - GST/PST on an album, but just GST on the shoot portion)
There are some kinks, especially if trying to work it with a team of employees that are not the best and if you aren't careful can result in double coverage or gaps. The timeline feature is helpful when it's not constantly freezing or crashing and is basic but when workings awesome! Quickbook link - doesn't completely speak with Quickbooks so if you also link a bank account it will result in double entries and occasional mis-logs. For us it was easier to disconnect, fix the past and just compare moving forward.
In the beginning even with the mass amount of help that it takes to set up it does require a lot of time. Which is quite reasonable since the program does so much you would have to input and invest so much time within that first week. You're creating, changing, evolving your paperwork, streamlining your work flow so it basically moving everything paper work wise about your business onto a computer system. Of course after you are all done with then everything is a cake walk.
Sería muy interesante que pudieran ampliar los lenguajes de la plataforma como por ejemplo el español, ya que actualmente está en inglés.
I would like to be able to upload my own spreadsheets
My one gripe about Honeybook, and the reason why I never ended up subscribing is that they are missing an essential field on the client information side. There is NO place to put the client's Business/Company Name. I work with individuals at businesses, but when it comes to invoicing or bringing up their information in Honeybook, I was unable to invoice the client under their Business Name. Instead I had to invoice them by their name, which is a huge blocker as I'm not invoicing an individual I'm invoicing the Company they work for. This was such a critical field and working with their customer service and sales rep, it had been requested in the past by others but never implemented. It just blew my mind how everything about Honeybook can be amazing but they don't have a field for Company Name!
I wish I could just easily take payments and not have to go through the code being emailed and my clients having to email it back. Often times there are unexpected things that come up in events that I need reimbursement for and I end up having to use Venmo or square or PayPal because I can’t do all the transactions here, but really wish I could. I would like more tiers to be able to not only manage my clients but also manage my vendors as well.
The only reason I stopped using it was that I was using wave accounting at the time and it was too much work to transfer the sales into it, I needed software that integrated with my payment software.
Would love to be able to set an out of office directly in the platform Not loving the new workflow changes
It's not really a con, but I don't use the community aspect of the platform. I'm sure it's amazing too though. 😄
Existen pequeñas deficiencias enla gestión de correos y sería genial que puedieran solucionar ese apartado, por lo demás HoneyBook va muy bien.
I have no cons to list at this time. I am very satisfied.
It did take a bit to figure out how to use it and get it set up! But totally worth it!
Maybe if we could go back to old proposals to duplicate them? I know when you start a new proposal, the last few pop up to duplicate... I would like to be able to duplicate any. I have return customers and though it's minimal, it would save time entering their data.
Would like to see an upgrade for sorting and filing, such as the option for "tags" on files. The invoicing system is very professional, but a little pricey. I would like to see the "cost" restructured.
It's take a learning curve, but you have templates for your propositions, mail and forms. First of all your need to make the mapping of your process and after you implement with Honeybook
First off when I registered I was told I would be receiving an email with a video or webinar on how to use the software, I waited because I had the time to invest when I purchased the software. You then took too long to send me the videos and I lost the time I had to invest in it. This software is so unbelievably hard to use, Client's are not called clients they are called projects, which is confusing in itself. And 'People' are for connections. I renamed the 'Questionnaires' so I could send them to clients and then when I went to send a questionnaire to my client they are named something else and there is 'Default' next to the default questionnaire in the email tab. But when I went to the 'Templates' tab the word "Default" was not next to any of the questionnaires, so how am I supposed to know what I am sending my clients. I want my money back. This software and the customer service is not great. I highly recommend looking elsewhere!
We have no run into any concerns at this time.
Definitely a learning curve and not being able to speak to someone on the phone for support can make it a bit frustrating when first learning.
I am not a big fan of the delay in the payment to my bank. Also, I can't figure out how to get an attachment to go in a workflow email?
When the outlook integration comes it will be damn near perfect!
I honestly cannot think of one con to using HoneyBook.
I would love it if it was geared a bit more towards senior photography versus wedding. I'd love to be able to put in client school and graduation year. Scheduling tool needs tweaked.
Because I was migrating from another system with many existing clients, onboarding was challenging. I would like to have had a personal and live onboarding session with specific advice on how best to set things up. It took a while to find the optimal use for brochures, proposals, invoices etc...
How we cannot process client credit card payments ourselves and how some clients don't understand how it works
Honeybook bases everything on the principle of a sales funnel. This can be overkill with established customers and projects that you simply want to migrate into the system.
No instant download system, does everything for you.
I would like the template contracts to automatically update in proposals. As it is right now I have to update all of the contracts in the proposal templates manually even after updating that very same contract in the contract templates section.
Setting up a workflow was time consuming and not very intuitive but so so worth it.
Unfortunately, in almost 2023, this is one of the only companies in my professional experience I've ever experienced racial bias. They went out of their way to offend me and as a privately-owned company, I guess they have it as a right, but I think the diverse demographic should be aware prior to spending money with this company.
The learning curve on how to use the templates, where things are for and all of the features became great for me. I am doing everything in my business so it is hard to have learn yet another tool and I am totally a tech person so I just needed time to teach myself on how to use all of the features that software has to offer. So take your time to learn.
We don't have any complaints. We book 40ish weddings a year and I strongly believe HoneyBook pushed us up to the next level with professionalism.
The thing I like least is the limitation when building templates for contracts, proposals, questionnaires, etc. - I am in the business of photography and delivering beautiful images is what sets my soul on fire! I wish I could add some of my images into some of my documents and have full control over the size and their location in the document. The way it is set up right now is a square crop on any image which can only be left, center, and right page. Dubsado has the leg up on Honeybook in that regard but otherwise I am totally happy with Honeybook.
Honestly would like to be able to schedule through the app, otherwise I’m satisfied.
Can’t figure out how to connect HB calendar with my iPhone calendar.
nobody told me about how easy it was to use once you get past the initial steps of getting everything plugged in. for people like me with mature businesses and busy days, it's hard, but trust me it's the best route to success for anyone in the independent creative field with clients and tons of admin work
The scheduling tool needs more intuition for photography - mini sessions (look at the site "use session") and to send an invoice and questionnaire automatically. Or to have the person choose the location when scheduling from a drop down.
In the beginning, it did not have many options to make the software look on brand from a client’s perspective or much flexibility and changing the design of brochures and templates. As a creative business it is important for our pieces to look custom designed, even down to our contract. This has improved significantly over the years!
I wish the deposits and payments made were a little clearer on my end so I don’t have the check the bank and HoneyBook at the same time to cross reference. That being said, I JUST started using the payment feature and it could be that I’m just not used to it yet.
Some features could use a bit of refining. My main concern is that the signature lines on contracts aren't customizable, and for someone operating an LLC, we need to be able to add a title next to our name so that we are signing on behalf of the company, rather than personally as ourselves. I would also love to see better integration with Quickbooks. I regularly have to go in to QB and manually edit the tax rate for each project so that it will categorize properly. I also have had regular issues with tax being calculated/rounded differently for HB vs QB so that they show $0.01 balance still due in QB after a project is paid in full via HB.
The only thing missing would be user levels so that I can give specific access to other members of my team. I use the team collaboration for many things now, but it would be more helpful to have restricted access instead. I kicked one star only because this is no longer such a necessary feature for me, but I still find it useful for users at large.
Wish the portal was more interactive on the client side.
This is the very powerful and very useful, different.
no cons really, only thing I could have done was sign up for this sooner and really focus on spending the 2-3 hours getting my business plugged into HoneyBook as soon as possible
The reason I didn't renew is the payment processing speed.
The pipeline is not 100% customizable and that is not ideal for my company as we have multiple types of clients that we work with differently as we move them from contract to event.
I would love if they could include email campaigns.
I wasn't able to easily use connect to Quickbooks online.
I think my biggest gripe is the bank transfer payment does take quite a long time to process. That being said it’s not so much their fault as it is the nature of the payment method. I wish there was more typeface options for the contact form, as that is the only thing that does not match my branding.
The app is not as intuitive as I think I would like and sometimes the emails are delayed and I will get the email in my inbox before it gets to HoneyBook.
There are small issues with email deliverability (i.e. ending up in spam) but there are workarounds to get that fixed!
I wish we could keep track of files! ALSO, wish we could send client galleries through honeybook! It would be a one-stop-shop! AND it would be cool if we could get prints for clients right through the app, too!
The new gift card option is amazing, I would love to see a particular spot for tracking these that have been purchased and used or not used.
With larger brochures and projects with more messages, it can take some time for everything to load. There are some limited features in the mobile app but neither has been significantly disruptive.
How long it takes for client payments to be deposited into my business bank account.
The software is awesome however, it is very difficult to get a grasp of if you are not tech savvy or if your team is a little bit Rusty in that department. if you can get over the learning curve then honeybooks will definitely be worth its weight in gold.
My only complaint is that you COULD be an all in one stop for photographers and offer client photo galleries and options to purchase prints and albums.
I wish I could delete or get rid of some of the templates it comes with. I also feel like it is not very easy to use from the clients end.
While HB shined in some ways, I guess it just wasn't what I expected in others. Payments lagged behind.
still has some growing pains, but they are really receptive of suggestions. Would like to be able to have email coro come from a chain, and not have to send new emails from the system each follow up. The brochure maker is limited at the moment. Would like to see it more customizable. In Canada your clients can't pay you with online bank transfers, only available for US businesses.
I can't share an easy access link to my brochures, and I would like a better template for recommended vendors that allows me to add photos or png logos
the integrations system is litlebit dificult, if you want to integrate with manual accounting system such as using microsoft excell
Navigating the software takes some time to learn but honestly as does any product. I am still not using Honeybook to it's fullest potential.
I am no able to download my brochure with photos correctly from the system. Just a few minor flaws in some of the programming.
The contracts could be a little more customizable and be easier to fill in to make it more specific for each client.
The sch. system is weird... id love to make that easier on me and my clients.
Just that it’s missing an employee portal with scheduling employees as an option.
I wish HB wasn't so laser-focused on wedding professionals--I'd love for them to provide more features for other creative professionals as well.
It takes some time to get set up and I wish there was some more flexibility in the pipeline customization.
Doesn't notify me when clients select services from my brochure to get more information about.
I run a video business, but we don't shoot weddings or events in the same way that regular videographers do, so being able to remove some of the "wedding-oriented" settings would be nice, but it's not a deal breaker (i.e. "budget, guests").
I honestly haven’t come across any issues yet! I love everything about HoneyBook!
This was a big program to adjust to. It took several months of trial and error to make the program fit into my work style. I think a personalized followup call from the concierge service would have cleared up most of the adjustment issues I had.
I. Love it all! Okay, I do wish I could click and share a package without having to create package and add the client's email.
Wish the contracts looked better when the it's downloaded to ta PDF to send to clients or is printed.
I can't think of anything I dislike about Honeybook. There are constantly new and helpful features being added and support has always been pretty quick to respond.
As much as I love the tool, it is not intuitive! None of the settings are where you think they would be and it's very difficult to find help documentation. I can't wait for them to add the feature of attaching a file like a PDF to a triggered email.
Initially there was no integration with Microsoft Outlook but this has now been fixed!!
The do updates a lot- which is great, but they can have bugs. usually they work out any issues associated with new features quickly.
I wish I could customized my lineup of tabs different and name them what I want (type over anything in the setup of HoneyBook) Wider range of fonts and ability to blog and send Pinterest links would be ideal. Font range could be expanded The ability to choose trial run dates would be ideal for makeup and hair
I don't care for the home page set up, sometimes notifications don't show for me or they clear before I've clicked them.
We wish that the scheduler was a bit more advanced and that the price wasn’t so high for all the features.
Through the phone app, it's an issue with setting up a new contact and then adding them to a new project. I can not go back to the home screen without restarting my phone.
Honeybook has a ways to go with the calendar feature, like inviting clients to events and scheduling meetings. But of all the things Honeybook has to offer, this doesn't ruin the experience for me.
I wish it had the option to schedule two or more sessions under a single project. For example, my wedding packages include an engagement session. However, I have to put the engagement session in as a separate project, which adds a step to the process. It’s only a minor inconvenience.
If you don't set it up exactly right, it's easy to make mistakes.
Love it all. Seriously! I haven't had one problem that wasn't addressed or fixed by a customer service representative.
The fact that there was ZERO support whatsoever may it an easy choice to stay away from this as a viable solution for our business long term.
The price per month/year is a little high for those of you that need something all in one but it does have a great support system.
The price can be kind of high if you're just starting out as a business, but it's totally worth it and the 50% off from a referral was a huge help.
I like all the program is interesting and clean
I don't like the fact that I don't have all of the features on the mobile app. But that's not really a big deal. I usually have my computer on hand.
Don’t have any at this time. Using this product has been great!
I would like to be able to creatively name and automate each step in my overall flow.
There are some odd hiccups - like I can block off days within HB. I have to use (and have yet to set up) a Calendly account. I'd rather just use HB for these things. I don't love how communication functions with clients. Clients have told me to "email them directly" because the HB platform is confusing to them. Maybe if all vendors used it and all of their planning happened on HB then it would not be so foreign to them, but currently it is frustrating for some of my clients.
I have no complaints right now. I'm so thrilled I found HoneyBook.
I didn't like seeing the charge come through for the full price when it renewed. I was unable to get a referral to get a referral discount.
The automations are a little clunky and you can’t change the text of an emails in a sequence after it’s been added to a sequence - which means Customers can get stuck in sequences with our dates information
The fact that some editing options are counterintuitive
It was a little intimidating to set up in the very beginning but the support team was so helpful and helped me get a head start. Now that I’ve learned the system, it’s actually hardly intimidating at all! Can’t think of any real cons
I have no dislikes for Honeybook as of now.
It would be nice if there was a bit more customization within the templates for brochure layouts to stay on brand with fonts and better, more custom image blocks.
Some things I would love to see added at some point: ability to add some custom information to client invoice receipts. Also, a link for clients to schedule meetings or shifts based on the availability that I enter into my calendar
Having to resend a proposal after it's signed AND after it's paid is kind of annoying. I also wish I could see what the clients sees sometimes.
Customer support. A conversation that could have taken 10 minutes turned into 3 days because the company had no urgency for customer support. I would suggest going with a different company.
There are lots of features we'd love to see eventually incorporated into the software.. such as organization functionality (We currently use Kerika) and a full CRM (we currently use Bitrix24). Would love to have an all-in-solution!
The only thing, which I am hoping is changing soon with this new update, I would would like to see is more customizable options for the documents, emails, brochures, etc…
I wish Honeybook rolled out more features regularly. I don't really know what I need until the Honeybook product team surprises me with an update. Those updates usually make me very happy.
I have no real cons about this product, If I had to choose one it would be feature implantation. Releasing new features quicker would help solve a couple of problems.
Can’t complain about to be honest. I would like to be able to see payments on the mobile app though.
It doesn't have an Android app as of Nov 2018
When you add multiple companies in the software and you email the client-it only shows the main company's email instead of the email associated with the corresponding company.
The price! HoneyBook is more expensive than competitors and periodically hints at future price increases. The current price is workable, but anything more expensive would be unaffordable for my small business.
None! Every feature has been beneficial.
I wish the mobile app version of HoneyBooks you were able to do a lot more but it’s okay. The web browser is way easier to do things on than the mobile app.
There isn't really much about the program that I dislike. I don't like that the automations now have two types of files (legacy and templates). They are basically the same and it really makes no sense to me why they exist separately, but it doesn't impede on using the software. Also, the reporting is good but it doesn't really make sense as it's not as functional as I'd like. You can't look at a report in the program, you have to download every time, but, I make due with what's available.
To use all the features of CRM, you need to hire a pro who can set you back at least $2k. Also, the payment deposits are the slowest on the market - days! If you use Square, you get the deposit the next day - same for all other CRMs. If you receive a payment on a Wednesday, for example, you won't get that deposit until at least Monday.
This product was pitched to our team as the supreme tool for doc management / / sharing / signatures, but it was no different, and had less features, than similar tools
The financial reports are not accurate. Also need easier login for multiple business logins. Deposits take a little longer sometimes
There's not much to like about it. It meets all of the things I was looking for in a CRM.
I would like more creative ability within the documents. Also don't like how some of the documents including invoices interact. It's hard to explain. It's both easy and complicated at the same time.
The setup process is a bit tricky and unless you have familiarized yourself with template creation, pay someone to build your templates, or find a premade on to edit to work for your needs it is a bit overwhelming if you have no experience at all with creating online templates or websites.
I honestly have no complaints about HoneyBook.
What I like least about HoneyBook is that there is no way to add a global discount code to a product or all products.
I do not have anything I like the least at the moment.
The templates are basic. For our business specifically we had to basically create a template, but that was the only negative.
Absolutely not user-friendly. I have used quite a few payment platforms but couldn't even send an invoice using this program.
The customer service can take a while to answer the phone or resolve a problem online
I have no complaints so far using HoneyBook.
There is nothing that I dislike about Honeybook.
Nothing, the application is fantastic!! I am so glad we have this amazing tool for our business!
HoneyBook does not allow client data to be exported. This may be an issue for those who would like to transfer the data within the contracts to another platform / tool. There is also a need for more integration with other platforms.
I haven't quite gotten around to learning all aspects of the software yet!
The mobile app, while handy, doesn’t offer all the features available on the desktop version, which can be a bit frustrating when you're on the go. Also, it’s a bit pricey, so it might not be the best option if you’re just starting out or have a tight budget.
I don’t think I have had any set backs with this
The price is expensive for solopreneurs. The features are overwhelming and there is a steep learning curve.
Can be a little confusing at first but eventually I learned about the tools.
One of the areas where I feel this platform could use some improvement is its reporting and analytics functionality. While the platform provides basic data on projects, payments, and clients, I would like access to more advanced and customizable metrics that allow me to more closely track how my business is performing.
They did an update this past year that has allowed for a lot of great automations. The only thing is, it has been extremely hard to keep up with and figure out how to use. (And I am pretty tech savy) But I do think they are great tools, it just takes a bit of time to figure out the changes. If you are new to honeybook, it's all you may know so it might work great!
Really no problem I like it I'm working on honeyBook today great and safe I hope see honeyBook soon number 1 on world service payment
With honey book it was very user friendly.
There are some small things i wish where available in the smart files, such as drop down lists and check boxes.
There are not many negatives to HoneyBook, all the tools are easy to use, records are always up to date, notifications are excellent and all transactions are documented efficiently.
I actually have no cons. My experience with Honey has been great.
The response time from customer service is not as effective and fast as I would like, they are good at their responses but they don't do it quickly
It’s not as good for booking group classes for clients compared to other websites. I will use the other website is set more...
The system has never failed me, I feel satisfied with each tool I use and I am convinced that it has been the most efficient platform that I use for my work tasks.
It didn't have the features I needed for the internal side of things when delegating to other contractors or staff
I don't have any dislikes thus far regarding the platform.
Customization was very limitrd. Not being able to add a designed invoice was a deal breaker for me.
Cuatomer service was a little slow responding to a question i had.
There really isn't anything that I don't like about Honeybook.
It became a little overwhelming when I was starting my business. It offered more than I needed. (good problem to have!)
I had a bit of trouble acclimating to emailing within the platform but now I have adjusted and know how easy it can be! Sometimes the emails land in client's spam but only once in a while!
The customer service response time isn't as prompt and efficient as I hope; while they provide good answers, they don't respond quickly.
Client experience if poor. Integrations are awful. Layout, design and look are atrocious and check out for clients is multi step.....Who does that anymore? We spent a week trying to get it setup and working well and efficiently....no way it was going to. And if we have to handhold it and manually do a TON of things.....why bother? MANY other options available and we've moved to one.
All the processes are useful and have had no inconsistencies in use, so on my part everything has turned out satisfactory.
As compared to others, The payout speed for invoices takes close to a week as opposed to a couple of days with other software I have tried. Perhaps that will change in the future.
Para quienes inician, pagar una mensualidad de esta clase puede ser un poco difícil, por lo tanto, al ser una aplicación enfocada en empresas pequeñas que están iniciando, debo darle un punto en contra al hecho del precio para quienes inician, debería haber una opción limitada para quienes inician con diferentes tipos de negocios
It could have better contract signing features.
No customer service. When they charge incorrectly you cannot reach them to get it corrected. Product was not impressive to start to have to deal with this billing issue.
Initial customisation takes time. Limited integration with certain third party apps.
I really enjoy using HONEYBOOK and all its features
Considering how helpful HoneyBook has been, no complaints.
limited advanced customization for workflows and only basic reporting.
There is currently nothing I dislike about Honeybook, it has been very effective and efficient.
I honestly don’t have any cons. This program is by far the best of it’s kind.
Pricing could be a little better but overall I really don’t have any cons.
I didn’t like that the pricing system was very high, especially for startup businesses
What I liked least about it was the price.
Still learning all the capabilities but no complaints yet
Il bouffe assez trop en connexion internet
Honeybook doesn't let you use your own email address after configuration.
That it doesn't connect or integrate at all to my other primary platform I use on a regular and daily basis.
I wish it was easier to integrate with other software.
Hi,If you don't want to be scammed, you must stay away from HoneyBook.Don't waste your valuable time and business by using HoneyBook.I won't say much, just say that if you accept payment through Honeybook, the payment will not come to you.Thank you
Unfortunately my clients said it was confusing and they didn't know how to work inside of it to do edits etc.
Price is pretty expensive for small businesses. There is no built-in time tracking.
I find it really expensive and it's not known to the general public.
Long term it just wasn't for me and my business
Should be able to have more functionality
Haven't found anything yet, perhaps as we go along. We are considering expanding our use to include invoicing and billing and will update review at that time.
While HoneyBook had many positive aspects, one thing I liked least was the limited reporting and analytics capabilities. The platform provided basic insights into my business metrics, such as income and project status, but I would have appreciated more in-depth reporting and analytics features. It would be beneficial to have access to more comprehensive data and visualizations to gain a deeper understanding of my business performance and make data-driven decisions.
Nothing wrong to report. A few bugs every now and then but I haven't seen one in a while.
There is virtually nothing about HoneyBook that I could ever say I don't like. HoneyBook has actually captured my heart. If I had one wish, it would be for a wider variety of design possibilities that are especially suited for producing compelling proposals and brochures. My love and admiration for HoneyBook, however, remain unwavering despite this nagging longing. Its extensive capabilities and user-friendly UI unquestionably improved my business operations to remarkable levels.
For the moment, I don't feel that anything with HoneyBook is missing at all.
Being able to navigate and the pricing per month.
Cost was expensive long term and not in out budget at the time but they do work with small businesses to help with that during slow times
So far i am very satisfied about all the feature from HoneyBook. Thank you !
Purtroppo, anche se Honeybook ha molte funzionalità interessanti, devo esprimere alcune critiche sulla piattaforma.Innanzitutto, il prezzo di Honeybook è piuttosto elevato rispetto ad altre soluzioni simili presenti sul mercato. Questo potrebbe essere un problema per molti freelance e piccole imprese che hanno un budget limitato e che non possono permettersi di pagare costi elevati per la gestione della loro attività.Inoltre, nonostante la piattaforma offra molte funzioni utili, ho notato che l'interfaccia utente di Honeybook può risultare un po' confusionaria e poco intuitiva. In particolare, ho trovato alcuni processi di configurazione dei modelli di contratto e dei form di contatto piuttosto complicati e poco user-friendly.Un altro aspetto negativo di Honeybook è che alcune funzionalità avanzate, come la possibilità di creare sondaggi personalizzati, sono disponibili solo per gli utenti che hanno sottoscritto il piano premium. Ciò significa che i clienti che hanno scelto il piano base potrebbero non avere accesso a tutte le funzioni di cui hanno bisogno per gestire la loro attività in modo efficace
Considero que los precios de HoneyBook son un poco elevados, especialmente para las pequeñas empresas.
Lack of integration with other softwares, it would be usefull p.e. to use with some microsoft programs.
None so far! I like this Honeybook. It is helpful to my business.
limited integrations and customisation to meet different types of businesses
L' interfaccia grafica non mi fa impazzire, ma è un opinione personale.
Quizás un punto negativo podría ser su precio. Aunque ofrece una prueba gratuita y planes de suscripción mensuales y anuales, para algunos usuarios puede resultar caro.
It stinks that Honeybook costs more than the other small business CRMs. It's got the extra stuff, yeah. But I wish they could bring it down a little. The other thing is that I wish they would let more outside apps integrate.
Customer service is pass-the-buck and no phone number and call backs hours to days later…don’t bother calling on a Friday afternoon, and if u do biz on weekends - too bad for you. Extremely slow to create something, it freezes, slow to upload assets, not intuitive to use whatsoever, help docs are vague. I once begged them to add non-gmail email and they told me their software was “not sophisticated” enough for me.
HoneyBook offers a range of pricing plans that are designed to be accessible to businesses of all sizes, the cost can add up quickly if you require a large number of features or have a high volume of transactions.Another potential issue with HoneyBook is its limited customization options. While the platform does provide users with a range of templates and pre-built workflows, some users may find that these are not customizable enough to fit their specific needs.
I have no complaints except that the proof reading capability could be enhanced in the platform and/or translation options available.
En mi opinión algo que deberían mejorar un poco es la interfaz, por momentos se hace pesada al cargar los elementos.
There are a few features I feel could be improved in Honeybook. The most notable one being a better editing and proofreading capability within the platform. Currently, it is difficult and tedious to check and make corrections to text, image and colors throughout a project.It would be great if there was an automated system that could help with this.
The worst part about it is getting started, but even THAT is pretty simple with their "concierge service" where you can send them your current forms and they'll digitize them for you!
HoneyBook shines for many industry professionals but isn't without a few details in need of improvement. Uploading files to customize templates can be difficult due to the restrictions placed on file types and sizes. Businesses with more non-traditional models may also find HoneyBook difficult to customize to meet their needs.
I'd love to see more detailed task management for independent contractors' collaboration, and for clients. I'd also request that HoneyBook connect with Zapier alternatives such as Pabbly Connect, Integrately, and Integromat.
Honestly, I don't really have anything I don't like. Maybe more space within the pipeline to be more tailored to my business (able to add more) And I'd like the option of uploading PDF's to templates like brochure. I like honey books brochure making ability.. but I also want more features and more control. Like building a webpage on squarespace. SO FUN
Starting out was the hardest part. As with any new software you must familiarize yourself with the product.
I am not too crazy about not being able to have one client on multiple workflows and the calendar feature is not as robust.
- Fees especially for third party countries- Some limited integration issues
The only thing that’s a little slow is the payment actually getting to my bank account. I’m not even sure if HB has anything to do with the time it takes, but I do wish it didn’t take 2 days to finally show up in my account. I wish there was an option to “instantly” transfer the funds for like a 1% fee. Like Venmo! That way if someone needs the money ASAP, they can instantly get it OR they can choose to wait the 1-2 business days to get the full payment. That would AMAZING
1. The email communication side of the app is very hit or miss. Where they soar with sending files and making payments a BREEZE, the ability to create a streamlined, semi-automated Follow-up process for leads that come in is sorely lacking. Even if HoneyBook never intends to be the best at that portion of sales, I feel it is a simple task to add a feature that makes it easy to add tags to leads so that you can export those contacts to a service that DOES soar in email communication and lead nurturing. 2. There is still a lot of room for more organization in the communication process from sales to project completion.
The cost of transitions when collecting online payments from clients
I want more email customization - better html features - add photo to my signature, add gifs, rename buttons and add them wherever I want in the email. I'd like it to manage my items better - have a place where I can update item pricing and descriptions and archive old items. I'd like better customization around the contact forms. Be able to match the text and font and fields closely to my website so that it integrates better onto my design. Be able to change colors of text and lines, and fonts and customize the lead contact form better.
The only things I wish that HoneyBook would improve on the most would be trying different variations with the project pipeline, with adding more availability or being able to choose between pipelines for different project types, & working out some kinks with the scheduling system between what we intend for clients to see in availability & what they actually see; & for the client to be able to go in & change their selection of date & time immediately afterwards & up to half an hour later.
How To guide is helpful to an extent. There were still things such as the automations and other issues I needed help with by my mentor who is also a photographer. She helped me set up my whole process cause it does not give you an example to let you know where to start with brochures, packages, invoice creations, etc.
I have very few quibbles with the software. Perhaps a bit more obvious control over the aesthetics of the brochures and documents would be nice, and I would love some additional automation, but overall the system works great and makes it so easy to manage everything that I have a hard time finding anything to complain about. I suppose that I would love an i-frame-based embed for the contact form. My portfolio site doesn't work with the embed type that honeybook provides.
The tasks need to be improved. The tasks only allow you to add it, but it doesn't allow the tasks to be sent to your email if it due tomorrow or today. You have to see the tasks in Honeybook to remember to do it. Also, I have the same tasks to do weekly, and you can't set up reoccurring tasks, which is a waste of time to type them in every week. The invoices need to be improved. Lots of my consulting clients are not allowed to use portals to go find the invoice. SO I have to print PDF the invoice and send it via email to my client. However, the print to PDF option does not make the PDF look very professional. It needs to be upgraded.
The client payment processing fees are more pricey than what I’ve used in the past and the instant deposit fees are through the roof. It takes up to 4 days otherwise for payments to arrive in your account, but I just wait it out due to the astronomical fees.
I would love to see a more flexible method for viewing pipelines and tasks. I prefer to view a Kanban-type of pipeline/workflow and tasks. I'd like to be able to click on a workflow and see how many clients/projects I have under it. I also don't like that I can't charge for certain appointment types. I would love to use the scheduling feature for booking mini sessions or other items that I would charge for outside of weddings/brand sessions. It would also be great if certain appointment types could work as lead capture forms (i.e.: when an appointment is booked, a new inquiry is created). For financial tracking, it would be nice to be able to create a recurring expense.
The calendar sync is sometimes glitchy, but that could also be user error. One thing that would make it better would be an easy way to override when I am considered "busy" on my Google Calendar that syncs in. I'd also love to have SMS communication with my clients, but rumor has it they are working on this.
There are little things that can be improved, but so does everything. I have voiced my suggestions to the HoneyBook team and they are passing the information along to try to improve my experience. Even without those being fixed, I still love HoneyBook.
The time tracker does not function to the extent that I need it to. I currently use Time Doctor to track my time, but it would be nice if I could keep everything in HoneyBook. Also, I oftentimes don't see my reminders for following up with "tasks" for clients in my projects pipeline. If there's a way to have those notifications automatically sync with my personal google calendar and send me an email reminder, that would be helpful. Pipedrive's CRM and sales pipeline does a really great job of showing urgent prospects to follow up with. I think it color-codes them too. Also, the email feature within HoneyBook can be a bit confusing. Sometimes, I can't tell if an email sent or not. The notes are also not displayed in a way that's very easy to read. It would be nice to add bullets, bold text, underline, etc. Pipedrive does a really great job of showing all of the email threads and notes between clients and multiple team members in their CRM. Also, the first time I sent an invoice, HoneyBook automatically included a place for gratuity/tip. I've now figured out how to turn that setting off, but I couldn't see that it was automatically included in my invoice ahead of time. With my business (and I think most), they will never need gratuity, so I think that's kind of an odd setting. Maybe instead of having to click and review the settings in the left side bar of invoices, there could be an extra prompt to review those settings before the user sends the proposal to their client.
The only thing I would like to see, and truly, I haven't asked, so it may even be there already; the monthly report of income shows the total of all contracts that came in during the month. We only collect a deposit from each. We would like to see the income report reflect just the deposit total of the month for our accounting purposes.
It takes a little effort to get to know the template process and what templates your business needs. We found that for a while we were nonstop creating templates because we offer such a variety of services. But now we have built up our system of templates that can easily be customized for a client.
It's annoying that I can't delete the default emails that came with my account to replace them with my own workflow, so myself or a team member doesn't get confused with their suggested emails vs. the ones I actually want to use.
I wish it was a little more upscale looking on fonts, colors and the user experience. My brand is more of a luxury brand so I want customers to feel like when they're being transferred to the contract or payment portion of our interactions that they're still receiving a luxury experience.
Would like to have more ability to make formatting changes (bullets, numbering, bold, etc.) when editing a document. I can do this on a new document, but not when editing an existing one. Workflows could be improved to have more triggers and the ability to automatically send files.
I don't like how many separate emails I need to make to send out my appointment scheduling.
The only con is that I didn’t find honeybook sooner! I don’t know how I did business without it. I look back at those times and laugh at how much work I was doing that didn’t even amount to half of what honeybook does for me!
I dislike that there is no option to arrange your date before booking. I only wish clients could choose the amount they want to pay at any given moment. Some of my clients find the email threads quite bothersome. In comparison to other firms, the processing and quick deposit costs appear to be expensive.
We wish the saving option when creating templated would improve due to work not being saved correctly. The undo option would be great. THE TEMPLATES. I just wish there were more as we use schedule emails frequently for follow ups, discovery calls, referrals, reminders, announcement, etc. The purpose of Smart Files is kind of pointless if I have to keep customizing my own templates.
I hope they allow us to ACTUALLY customize our project pipeline at some point. Not everyone has the same process, and there is stuff I can't take off because it's default. I also wish there was an easier way to just send someone to the item to be sold page rather than taking them to a pipeline, we all get leads differently, and I'd like to skip a step for some people.
I was expecting more from the workflow and would love the option to create a link so clients can open the link to get to the invoice to make the payment. As much as I’d love everyone to use the client portal, not everyone can handle it and this would be a great feature for older, less tech-savvy clients.
The app. The time tracking - the fact you have to calculate the time in fractions, what should have been an easy task becomes a "let me google what 1h35min is in time fractions". You can just put the time in the app, but not on the webapp. But I can never login at the app because it doesn't accept Google SSO, but it does on the web, so I always have to change my password. The app doesn't stay connected for long. So I just don't use the app, I have it installed because maybe one day it will update and login with Google.
Truthfully, I can't really think of anything that I would add or change about HoneyBook. They have been really thoughtful in their development process.
There are times when I donate photo sessions to non-profits and want to be able to send an invoice showing how much the session would have cost, then adding a discount to show a $0 invoice but there is not a way to send that without charging the invoice and refunding. I wish that I could do more on the mobile app, but new features are being added frequently.
The contract templates are pretty limited to social media management and marketing ops. I think that every business needs their own contracts, period, but it would be nice to have a better starting place for other service providers. Additionally, the emails that Honeybook kicks out for proposals, payments, contracts and the like have reportedly found their way to many of my customer's spam box. I just warn them ahead of time, but it's not super reassuring to some more leery customers.
I would like it if the appointment scheduler allowed us to ask prospects questions and charge a fee like Calendly, and that the time tracker was more profound like Clockify.
There could maybe be more freedom to customize but really it's just an advanced issue. First world problems.
Sometimes editing things for a client when they don't like it is more difficult such as payment dates or legal terms if you include the contract with the invoice in the proposal template.
There’s a little room for improvement, which the wonderful customer service has my suggestions about, but those things will only enhance an already great product.
After a client pays their invoice, it usually takes 12-24 hours for Honeybook to send me a confirmation email saying they've paid. This is (I don't use this word often) absurd. With Quickbooks, I know payment confirmation comes in within 10 minutes. Especially if I am going to start work with a client right as they pay, this hurdle in their platform stops me from getting to work right away. It usually leads to me emailing my customer "Did you pay the invoice?" then them replying "I did!" then me looking into Honeybook wondering why the heck it hasn't come in and making me look foolish to my client... Then I finally get the notification the next day. It's the #1 feature request they need to get updated.
The program has so many capabilities that I know I am not using it to its full potential. Because each company is different I know it would be impossible to walk everyone through what their company needs but I wish I could snap my fingers and understand it all
1. I wish there was more internal automation, like the workflow applied just sent out the emails and not prompted me to act. 2. While “linked” with Calendly, it’s not linked in the correct way. I wish when someone signed up for a slot in Calendly, it could generate an automatic proposal that I could look over before sending, or sent automatically. When adding my “Calendly link” to a honeybook email, the link always fails. I don’t use Calendly enough to have this be a major issue, just a nuisance. 3. More flexibility in personal branding & branding the contact form. I don’t currently use the form on my site because of this.
I have no cons. This meets and exceeds all expectations that I would have for a CRM.
The only thing I’m not too big on is app limitation. I need a few more feature like editing calendar and schedule availability when I’m not on my iPad or computer and just have my phone.
I wish I could have had the same email signature in the platform as I did on my email platform.
The only complaint I have is that you can’t access all the same features and do all the same things on the Honeybook app as you can on a computer. This is only a very minor dislike because most important features are usable in the app!
A couple of things I would like to see improved on would be workflow triggers and customization of default emails.
I don't have a con...Although it is worth each penny that they charge, it is hard justifying when business stopped bc of a virus (which shall not be named lol) I wanted to keep it to keep everything together but could not when even communication stopped with clients for a while.
I am a new user and it's a little difficult to set up to how I do business. It's taking me a lot longer than I would like to get things just how I want them. There are things I want to change such as the flow of automatic emails. I am having a hard time figuring out exactly where to change those settings.
The only thing i wish were better is the calendar system. It would be nice to be able to block dates out on the calendar to avoid booking, like if you had planned a vacation. I also with it would sync directly to ical. I hate having to make it use google becuase if google runs out of space it doesnt tell me and then i have a calendar issue.
In contracts the most frustrating thing is that you can only add line items at the very bottom of the invoice. That means if you have a very long invoice and want to add a line to the top of the page, you have to add a line at the bottom and drag it all the way up to the top ( which is extremely tedious ). It wastes so much time that it made me wonder if we wasted more time trying to use this clunky app than just doing things the way we were used to in excel!
Some things aren't really intuitive so I have to use the help resources or ask customer support for help in figuring things out. The great thing is that the support team is really easy to chat with and makes things really simple.
I am a "founding" Honeybook user and bought the lifetime membership. At first, HB was very convenient. The learning curve was very frustrating as the online software had many MANY bugs. It still does. The entire premise behind the software was to free up your time, have all your projects in one place, sign contract, get paid, etc. Yes, great idea! However, the software has so many glitches! You're not able to even edit a person in your contacts. Their customer support team used to be great you could actually message a real person - now you have to wait a day or two to get an email answer and most of the time they just send you a link to deal with your problem. Once you email your client the contract, everything goes down the Honeybook "rabbit hole". My clients are tech savvy and they can't even figure out Honeybook - the emails that I've received from frustrated clients is numerous. Save your time and money and get another online software that will actually do the job - like Sprout Studio or Dubsado. Wish I would have done that from the beginning. Regretting my purchase since my lifetime "membership" isn't transferrable and Honeybook continues to make money off of me by accepting credit card payments. I looked at 17hats, which also didn't have great reviews before I purchased Honeybook. Moving on, however, I'm assuming that the process will not be easy transferring existing contracts and other office files.
Couple little things here and there, like a box won't move where I want it to in Flows, but they are always tweaking and adding new features. The customer service is also stellar so if anything goes wrong I know someone will be able to help me right away!
I have nothing bad to say about Honeybook
All is great and hope to learn about more tools that I am not using
As a professional designer, I'm used to being able to create whatever I need in my design software, but was thrilled to be able to remove that tedious aspect from my workflow after setting up brochures in HoneyBook. I would love some increased functionality and flexibility in those brochure templates, but that's certainly not going to keep me from using this amazing tool.
For our industry, it is lacking an edidable document such as a BEO or Event Details Sheet - I wish this type of document would be an option.
After booking the client; PM automations are quite lacking - would need a separate solution to assist with that. Would love for it to be incorporated
The scheduling app could be more robust, but I still love it.
There is nothing about Honeybook that I would change.
It is a lot to set up in the beginning but way worth it. It saves so much time in the long run with workflows and saved templates.
- it would be cool if the email editor in the platform had more functionality but the workaround is to style your email in a Google doc and copy/paste it into the editor (assuming you don't want to include GIFs of videos- which have to be sent as attachments)
I wish it had better financials. More comprehensive reports and the ability to auto populate expenses into their categories.
Can’t think of anything I don’t like about this software.
There's really not much I don't use or don't like. I would like for my call scheduling to be able to automatically sync to my iCal for my iphone, and maybe some personalized help on automating workflows, but these are wish list items!
Some of the features I would like to see in the future would be the ability to integrate a "store"-like function directly into the crm. I would like my clients to be able to choose from options that I offer and those choices to become a proposal or invoice.
I honestly can't think of anything I don't like. I thought I liked my old program a few years ago, but when it went defunct and I had to change, I was so grateful I was forced into an upgrade. I did not know what I was missing. This program simplified the management of my business beyond what I thought was possible.
The amount of time and understanding of the software and processes needed to create your leads management, project management, proposal, and booking pipelines is overwhelming sometimes alot is truly too much.
I think in the beginning there was a learning curve that was pretty tough. However, customer service was absolutely amazing and helped a lot. I would recommend adding a way to upload receipts to the business expenses! I’d love to just export that into a spreadsheet for my accountant and they have everything they need there. I do not use Quickbooks as I bookkeep everything myself. So that could help a lot!
As a business owner and freelancer, I find HoneyBook to be an excellent tool. However, there are a few areas where it could use improvement. For instance, while it has many templates and tools to help streamline business processes, I find it difficult to customize the software to fit my individual needs. Additionally, the user interface can be challenging to navigate for those who are not tech-savvy, making the learning curve a bit steep.
I was basically using email, so having all of my communication in one place made things so much easier. It's my one stop place for keeping track of communication with clients and their designs/perferences throughout the planning process.
The mobile app as with any mobile app version of software is a little bit more limited but that is the only thing that bothers me. Most things I can still accomplish with ease.
Absolutely nothing. It’s flawless, and every time they come up with something new, it’s something I never knew I needed. There’s nothing to not like!
I really wish that Batch Emailing had more options. We often need to send specific batch emails to our clients dependednt on which stage they are at on our timeline. Only having the options to hand select each client to send the batch emails to or to send them to our entire client list is an inefficient use of our time and thus we find no use for this tool that has so much potential to be so valuable to our business.
Definitely Would like to see a review questionnaire or rating system with an HTML generator plugin that could be used to post on my website or google ad. Updated training videos for the new features.
Of all the features in honey book, I would love to see an actual timer. The hours log is excellent adding a clock to this feature would put it over the top!
It took me a while to navigate through all the different options. I think a run-through video would be amazing!
I would like the ability to look up a clients files by date - the calendar only shows bookings that have a retainer paid. I'd like to search by date and find prospectives. I'd like to search by category - for instance school dances versus weddings versus company parties. And, I'd like to see reports of how many of each type of gig we do each year.
No I'm very happy. There's honestly nothing I would change.
The only thing have to say that is bad about this program is when there is an update of change. Opening up the program to do something and finding that things have changed with no notice is frustrating.
Hasta el momento no he tenido inconvenientes con Honeybook, el sistema va de maravilla y siempre que tengo una duda puedo consultar a servicio de atención al cliente.
The only thing I would like to see is an option to merge/combine projects. As a wedding planner, I'm often included in contracts sent to my couples. It's no surprise that they use HoneyBook too! I end up with multiple projects for the same couple from different vendors.
I would like a more robust Archive management, and a comprehensive workflow automation system, but I know they are working on it.
If I absolutely had to say something I didn’t like. It would be that I wish I could upload bigger pictures so that I could make better brochures/ contracts.
During the initial trial with honeybook, I did not use it at all. I found it confusing and really did not know where to start or how to start it. I decided if I was going to really see what it I was all about I needed help. I hired a HB Pro [SENSITIVE CONTENT] and that made the world of difference. Of course, when I hired a pro before I ever used HB, I asked myself what I was doing spending money on a program I can’t even use !!!LOL. [SENSITIVE CONTENT] is very important to me and her automations and beautiful graphics opened up a world of HB.
The only thing I'm having issues with right now is making a brochure. It probably user error, but I wish it there more extensive editing capabilities within the brochure making operation. I will play around with it some more though.
I have very few negative things to say about HoneyBook. The couple things I did note that may be helpful in the future, HoneyBook wants to know about. They offer surveys and take users suggestions to possibly implement in the future. All things were very minor and don't take away from the overall experience of using HoneyBook.
I wish there were more options for the pre made templates, that we can title and choose from. For now, I can only make the one follow up email. There are others that I would like to make. Also, I wish I could change the body of the email and it would save it to how I would like to word it. For now, I have to change some wording around every time I send out files to my potential clients. I also really would like to be able to make a timeline through HoneyBook. For now I have to create it in another space and email it separately to my client. It would be nice to have it all under the same file, especially with handling so many brides and weddings.
Con mentioned in previous question when asked how can you improve
Aunque HoneyBook tiene una plataforma muy intuitiva, si es necesario que realices configuraciones según los requerimientos del emprendedor, esto puede tomar algo de tiempo.
I have not experienced any glitches on the platform that was not solved very quickly. One glitch I had recently was that the project page was not loading, but they had a notification on the side stating that their team is already working on this issue before I noticed it.
I don’t like how I can’t edit proposals and invoices through my cellphone on the app, and how long it takes to receive payment.
I wish there was a reward system to offer my clients. Something that would give them a discount on their next purchase with me once they’ve spent a certain amount with our business. It would be nice if HoneyBook could integrate that option.
The only feature I wish I could have used a little differently would be a way to connect a Google Drive folder (it's where I work through content for a web design project with my client, so it needs to be more collaborative than a final pdf)
I would like to see more scheduling abilities from the app.
Sometimes it is too progressive for me! I am after all a photog and not a tech geek. That’s when I reach out for help, and the support team is there to walk me through.
I would like the ability to chose the date of expiration, versus week to week.
- Refunds don’t sync to QuickBooks - 3% payment processing fee is too expensive - Delay in funds being deposited into bank account - Inability to charge different sales tax rates for different items.
Not anything major to say, other than the iOS app is a little limited to what can be done on it. Compared to the laptop / desktop web browser version.
I least like that I cannot decide more of what I would like my clients to be able to see within the project. (I may be incorrect in saying this and not yet know how to do this.)
no scheduling within the software in which I heard they were working on this. The ability to add someone that works for you and not see contract just logistics.
I wish I could integrate it into my website.
The only con I have found with Honeybook is the lack of a download feature for contracts and invoices after they've been executed.
Being a new product there are some areas that would be nice to see (i.e. reimbursable expense capture) but has all of the core features you really need to make the investment worth it.
They're stuck in the Stripe system for payments with zero other options. We run our businesses using PayPal and the lack of paymention options pales in comparison to a couple of the CRM competitors out there. The app could use with a UX/UI redesign for the new decade. It's easy to use, but could be much better.
I do wish, that the scheduling aspect was better equip for mini sessions, and different events you can host!
The only thing that is missing for me right now is that there are no integrations with other accounting programs besides quickbooks, and that the task management portion isn't quite as robust as I would like it to be.
When responding to an email through the software, it makes a new email. Some clients have more questions and I’d like a way to organize with in a project the emails.
I wish I could add gifs to my emails. They are kinda my thing.
I wish the system was able to better track email correspondence in a long tread that was readable by both the customers and the user.
I don't have much to dislike about Honeybook! The only thing that I think could use improvement is the mobile app functionality, but it is mobile and therefore limited. I also wish that I would've been exposed to team workflows early on, but it's not hard to figure out once you have a general understanding of the software!
I don't like the scheduling too much and that there is no way to tag people in the same groups.
The ONLY things I dislike about the software are very minor. I wish that I could customize the project phases more, I wish that I had a live stop/start time tracking feature, I wish that I could customize the wording of my payment reminders, I wish that I could send an invoice from a proposal without duplicating the payment in the project (clients ask for that for their records), and I wish there was an iPad app.
The learning curve is a little higher than other applications, but I think it is because it is so unique in its mission - to help organize multiple parts of a photography business.
I would like to be able to track if a client clicks on a URL or opens an attachment within an email. Currently, you can only see if they've opened the email and how many times. This would be extremely helpful.
Landing page options and or lead magnet delivery option from contact form.
Difficult for clients to find current versions of proposals when looking for it from emails Some shortcomings when working with teams (sharing proposals / contracts / invoices)
Honestly there’s not really a whole lot of cons the only one that I can think of is that the mobile app is not as interactive as if you were using a computer or laptop but honey book constantly works on improving things so I’m sure that in the future it will be fully interactive from your phone where you can check on things like bookkeeping and Send out contacts faster. So for me it’s not really a con just something to be aware of other than that I really honestly can’t really think of any cons.
If email marketing was built in, this would be an incredible way to manage leads and stay connected to my customers! Since I also do coaching, it would be helpful to have paid session options in the scheduler to allow my clients to schedule and pay at the same time.
There really isn’t much that I don’t like about it. Some stores are not currently with honey books and that would be my only true complaint!
I wish I could go back to an email besides the last one and still reply to that rather than have to always start a new thread. I don't like that I can't tell if I have sent the Client Portal link to a client or not. I have a difficult time with the copy/paste function on my keyboard inside Honeybook.
Vendors I've worked with have used Honeybook for contracts and payment to reserve workshop spaces. While it was easy to access and deliver payment, I found that the information in the shared account was not encrypted. So sensitive information like full payment methods were visible to anyone who had access to the account. This made me uneasy in the instance someone would gain access to the shared documents who did not have permission.
I wish that there was the option to tax different parts within an invoice (ie - GST/PST on an album, but just GST on the shoot portion)
There are some kinks, especially if trying to work it with a team of employees that are not the best and if you aren't careful can result in double coverage or gaps. The timeline feature is helpful when it's not constantly freezing or crashing and is basic but when workings awesome! Quickbook link - doesn't completely speak with Quickbooks so if you also link a bank account it will result in double entries and occasional mis-logs. For us it was easier to disconnect, fix the past and just compare moving forward.
In the beginning even with the mass amount of help that it takes to set up it does require a lot of time. Which is quite reasonable since the program does so much you would have to input and invest so much time within that first week. You're creating, changing, evolving your paperwork, streamlining your work flow so it basically moving everything paper work wise about your business onto a computer system. Of course after you are all done with then everything is a cake walk.
Sería muy interesante que pudieran ampliar los lenguajes de la plataforma como por ejemplo el español, ya que actualmente está en inglés.
I would like to be able to upload my own spreadsheets
My one gripe about Honeybook, and the reason why I never ended up subscribing is that they are missing an essential field on the client information side. There is NO place to put the client's Business/Company Name. I work with individuals at businesses, but when it comes to invoicing or bringing up their information in Honeybook, I was unable to invoice the client under their Business Name. Instead I had to invoice them by their name, which is a huge blocker as I'm not invoicing an individual I'm invoicing the Company they work for. This was such a critical field and working with their customer service and sales rep, it had been requested in the past by others but never implemented. It just blew my mind how everything about Honeybook can be amazing but they don't have a field for Company Name!
I wish I could just easily take payments and not have to go through the code being emailed and my clients having to email it back. Often times there are unexpected things that come up in events that I need reimbursement for and I end up having to use Venmo or square or PayPal because I can’t do all the transactions here, but really wish I could. I would like more tiers to be able to not only manage my clients but also manage my vendors as well.
The only reason I stopped using it was that I was using wave accounting at the time and it was too much work to transfer the sales into it, I needed software that integrated with my payment software.
Would love to be able to set an out of office directly in the platform Not loving the new workflow changes
It's not really a con, but I don't use the community aspect of the platform. I'm sure it's amazing too though. 😄
Existen pequeñas deficiencias enla gestión de correos y sería genial que puedieran solucionar ese apartado, por lo demás HoneyBook va muy bien.
I have no cons to list at this time. I am very satisfied.
It did take a bit to figure out how to use it and get it set up! But totally worth it!
Maybe if we could go back to old proposals to duplicate them? I know when you start a new proposal, the last few pop up to duplicate... I would like to be able to duplicate any. I have return customers and though it's minimal, it would save time entering their data.
Would like to see an upgrade for sorting and filing, such as the option for "tags" on files. The invoicing system is very professional, but a little pricey. I would like to see the "cost" restructured.
It's take a learning curve, but you have templates for your propositions, mail and forms. First of all your need to make the mapping of your process and after you implement with Honeybook
First off when I registered I was told I would be receiving an email with a video or webinar on how to use the software, I waited because I had the time to invest when I purchased the software. You then took too long to send me the videos and I lost the time I had to invest in it. This software is so unbelievably hard to use, Client's are not called clients they are called projects, which is confusing in itself. And 'People' are for connections. I renamed the 'Questionnaires' so I could send them to clients and then when I went to send a questionnaire to my client they are named something else and there is 'Default' next to the default questionnaire in the email tab. But when I went to the 'Templates' tab the word "Default" was not next to any of the questionnaires, so how am I supposed to know what I am sending my clients. I want my money back. This software and the customer service is not great. I highly recommend looking elsewhere!
We have no run into any concerns at this time.
Definitely a learning curve and not being able to speak to someone on the phone for support can make it a bit frustrating when first learning.
I am not a big fan of the delay in the payment to my bank. Also, I can't figure out how to get an attachment to go in a workflow email?
When the outlook integration comes it will be damn near perfect!
I honestly cannot think of one con to using HoneyBook.
I would love it if it was geared a bit more towards senior photography versus wedding. I'd love to be able to put in client school and graduation year. Scheduling tool needs tweaked.
Because I was migrating from another system with many existing clients, onboarding was challenging. I would like to have had a personal and live onboarding session with specific advice on how best to set things up. It took a while to find the optimal use for brochures, proposals, invoices etc...
How we cannot process client credit card payments ourselves and how some clients don't understand how it works
Honeybook bases everything on the principle of a sales funnel. This can be overkill with established customers and projects that you simply want to migrate into the system.
No instant download system, does everything for you.
I would like the template contracts to automatically update in proposals. As it is right now I have to update all of the contracts in the proposal templates manually even after updating that very same contract in the contract templates section.
Setting up a workflow was time consuming and not very intuitive but so so worth it.
Unfortunately, in almost 2023, this is one of the only companies in my professional experience I've ever experienced racial bias. They went out of their way to offend me and as a privately-owned company, I guess they have it as a right, but I think the diverse demographic should be aware prior to spending money with this company.
The learning curve on how to use the templates, where things are for and all of the features became great for me. I am doing everything in my business so it is hard to have learn yet another tool and I am totally a tech person so I just needed time to teach myself on how to use all of the features that software has to offer. So take your time to learn.
We don't have any complaints. We book 40ish weddings a year and I strongly believe HoneyBook pushed us up to the next level with professionalism.
The thing I like least is the limitation when building templates for contracts, proposals, questionnaires, etc. - I am in the business of photography and delivering beautiful images is what sets my soul on fire! I wish I could add some of my images into some of my documents and have full control over the size and their location in the document. The way it is set up right now is a square crop on any image which can only be left, center, and right page. Dubsado has the leg up on Honeybook in that regard but otherwise I am totally happy with Honeybook.
Honestly would like to be able to schedule through the app, otherwise I’m satisfied.
Can’t figure out how to connect HB calendar with my iPhone calendar.
nobody told me about how easy it was to use once you get past the initial steps of getting everything plugged in. for people like me with mature businesses and busy days, it's hard, but trust me it's the best route to success for anyone in the independent creative field with clients and tons of admin work
The scheduling tool needs more intuition for photography - mini sessions (look at the site "use session") and to send an invoice and questionnaire automatically. Or to have the person choose the location when scheduling from a drop down.
In the beginning, it did not have many options to make the software look on brand from a client’s perspective or much flexibility and changing the design of brochures and templates. As a creative business it is important for our pieces to look custom designed, even down to our contract. This has improved significantly over the years!
I wish the deposits and payments made were a little clearer on my end so I don’t have the check the bank and HoneyBook at the same time to cross reference. That being said, I JUST started using the payment feature and it could be that I’m just not used to it yet.
Some features could use a bit of refining. My main concern is that the signature lines on contracts aren't customizable, and for someone operating an LLC, we need to be able to add a title next to our name so that we are signing on behalf of the company, rather than personally as ourselves. I would also love to see better integration with Quickbooks. I regularly have to go in to QB and manually edit the tax rate for each project so that it will categorize properly. I also have had regular issues with tax being calculated/rounded differently for HB vs QB so that they show $0.01 balance still due in QB after a project is paid in full via HB.
The only thing missing would be user levels so that I can give specific access to other members of my team. I use the team collaboration for many things now, but it would be more helpful to have restricted access instead. I kicked one star only because this is no longer such a necessary feature for me, but I still find it useful for users at large.
Wish the portal was more interactive on the client side.
This is the very powerful and very useful, different.
no cons really, only thing I could have done was sign up for this sooner and really focus on spending the 2-3 hours getting my business plugged into HoneyBook as soon as possible
The reason I didn't renew is the payment processing speed.
The pipeline is not 100% customizable and that is not ideal for my company as we have multiple types of clients that we work with differently as we move them from contract to event.
I would love if they could include email campaigns.
I wasn't able to easily use connect to Quickbooks online.
I think my biggest gripe is the bank transfer payment does take quite a long time to process. That being said it’s not so much their fault as it is the nature of the payment method. I wish there was more typeface options for the contact form, as that is the only thing that does not match my branding.
The app is not as intuitive as I think I would like and sometimes the emails are delayed and I will get the email in my inbox before it gets to HoneyBook.
There are small issues with email deliverability (i.e. ending up in spam) but there are workarounds to get that fixed!
I wish we could keep track of files! ALSO, wish we could send client galleries through honeybook! It would be a one-stop-shop! AND it would be cool if we could get prints for clients right through the app, too!
The new gift card option is amazing, I would love to see a particular spot for tracking these that have been purchased and used or not used.
With larger brochures and projects with more messages, it can take some time for everything to load. There are some limited features in the mobile app but neither has been significantly disruptive.
How long it takes for client payments to be deposited into my business bank account.
The software is awesome however, it is very difficult to get a grasp of if you are not tech savvy or if your team is a little bit Rusty in that department. if you can get over the learning curve then honeybooks will definitely be worth its weight in gold.
My only complaint is that you COULD be an all in one stop for photographers and offer client photo galleries and options to purchase prints and albums.
I wish I could delete or get rid of some of the templates it comes with. I also feel like it is not very easy to use from the clients end.
While HB shined in some ways, I guess it just wasn't what I expected in others. Payments lagged behind.
still has some growing pains, but they are really receptive of suggestions. Would like to be able to have email coro come from a chain, and not have to send new emails from the system each follow up. The brochure maker is limited at the moment. Would like to see it more customizable. In Canada your clients can't pay you with online bank transfers, only available for US businesses.
I can't share an easy access link to my brochures, and I would like a better template for recommended vendors that allows me to add photos or png logos
the integrations system is litlebit dificult, if you want to integrate with manual accounting system such as using microsoft excell
Navigating the software takes some time to learn but honestly as does any product. I am still not using Honeybook to it's fullest potential.
I am no able to download my brochure with photos correctly from the system. Just a few minor flaws in some of the programming.
The contracts could be a little more customizable and be easier to fill in to make it more specific for each client.
The sch. system is weird... id love to make that easier on me and my clients.
Just that it’s missing an employee portal with scheduling employees as an option.
I wish HB wasn't so laser-focused on wedding professionals--I'd love for them to provide more features for other creative professionals as well.
It takes some time to get set up and I wish there was some more flexibility in the pipeline customization.
Doesn't notify me when clients select services from my brochure to get more information about.
I run a video business, but we don't shoot weddings or events in the same way that regular videographers do, so being able to remove some of the "wedding-oriented" settings would be nice, but it's not a deal breaker (i.e. "budget, guests").
I honestly haven’t come across any issues yet! I love everything about HoneyBook!
This was a big program to adjust to. It took several months of trial and error to make the program fit into my work style. I think a personalized followup call from the concierge service would have cleared up most of the adjustment issues I had.
I. Love it all! Okay, I do wish I could click and share a package without having to create package and add the client's email.
Wish the contracts looked better when the it's downloaded to ta PDF to send to clients or is printed.
I can't think of anything I dislike about Honeybook. There are constantly new and helpful features being added and support has always been pretty quick to respond.
As much as I love the tool, it is not intuitive! None of the settings are where you think they would be and it's very difficult to find help documentation. I can't wait for them to add the feature of attaching a file like a PDF to a triggered email.
Initially there was no integration with Microsoft Outlook but this has now been fixed!!
The do updates a lot- which is great, but they can have bugs. usually they work out any issues associated with new features quickly.
I wish I could customized my lineup of tabs different and name them what I want (type over anything in the setup of HoneyBook) Wider range of fonts and ability to blog and send Pinterest links would be ideal. Font range could be expanded The ability to choose trial run dates would be ideal for makeup and hair
I don't care for the home page set up, sometimes notifications don't show for me or they clear before I've clicked them.
We wish that the scheduler was a bit more advanced and that the price wasn’t so high for all the features.
Through the phone app, it's an issue with setting up a new contact and then adding them to a new project. I can not go back to the home screen without restarting my phone.
Honeybook has a ways to go with the calendar feature, like inviting clients to events and scheduling meetings. But of all the things Honeybook has to offer, this doesn't ruin the experience for me.
I wish it had the option to schedule two or more sessions under a single project. For example, my wedding packages include an engagement session. However, I have to put the engagement session in as a separate project, which adds a step to the process. It’s only a minor inconvenience.
If you don't set it up exactly right, it's easy to make mistakes.
Love it all. Seriously! I haven't had one problem that wasn't addressed or fixed by a customer service representative.
The fact that there was ZERO support whatsoever may it an easy choice to stay away from this as a viable solution for our business long term.
The price per month/year is a little high for those of you that need something all in one but it does have a great support system.
The price can be kind of high if you're just starting out as a business, but it's totally worth it and the 50% off from a referral was a huge help.
I like all the program is interesting and clean
I don't like the fact that I don't have all of the features on the mobile app. But that's not really a big deal. I usually have my computer on hand.
Don’t have any at this time. Using this product has been great!
I would like to be able to creatively name and automate each step in my overall flow.
There are some odd hiccups - like I can block off days within HB. I have to use (and have yet to set up) a Calendly account. I'd rather just use HB for these things. I don't love how communication functions with clients. Clients have told me to "email them directly" because the HB platform is confusing to them. Maybe if all vendors used it and all of their planning happened on HB then it would not be so foreign to them, but currently it is frustrating for some of my clients.
I have no complaints right now. I'm so thrilled I found HoneyBook.
I didn't like seeing the charge come through for the full price when it renewed. I was unable to get a referral to get a referral discount.
The automations are a little clunky and you can’t change the text of an emails in a sequence after it’s been added to a sequence - which means Customers can get stuck in sequences with our dates information
The fact that some editing options are counterintuitive
It was a little intimidating to set up in the very beginning but the support team was so helpful and helped me get a head start. Now that I’ve learned the system, it’s actually hardly intimidating at all! Can’t think of any real cons
I have no dislikes for Honeybook as of now.
It would be nice if there was a bit more customization within the templates for brochure layouts to stay on brand with fonts and better, more custom image blocks.
Some things I would love to see added at some point: ability to add some custom information to client invoice receipts. Also, a link for clients to schedule meetings or shifts based on the availability that I enter into my calendar
Having to resend a proposal after it's signed AND after it's paid is kind of annoying. I also wish I could see what the clients sees sometimes.
Customer support. A conversation that could have taken 10 minutes turned into 3 days because the company had no urgency for customer support. I would suggest going with a different company.
There are lots of features we'd love to see eventually incorporated into the software.. such as organization functionality (We currently use Kerika) and a full CRM (we currently use Bitrix24). Would love to have an all-in-solution!
The only thing, which I am hoping is changing soon with this new update, I would would like to see is more customizable options for the documents, emails, brochures, etc…
I wish Honeybook rolled out more features regularly. I don't really know what I need until the Honeybook product team surprises me with an update. Those updates usually make me very happy.
I have no real cons about this product, If I had to choose one it would be feature implantation. Releasing new features quicker would help solve a couple of problems.
Can’t complain about to be honest. I would like to be able to see payments on the mobile app though.
It doesn't have an Android app as of Nov 2018
When you add multiple companies in the software and you email the client-it only shows the main company's email instead of the email associated with the corresponding company.
The price! HoneyBook is more expensive than competitors and periodically hints at future price increases. The current price is workable, but anything more expensive would be unaffordable for my small business.
None! Every feature has been beneficial.
I wish the mobile app version of HoneyBooks you were able to do a lot more but it’s okay. The web browser is way easier to do things on than the mobile app.
